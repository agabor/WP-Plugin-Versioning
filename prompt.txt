Write an accessible, conversational article titled "Keep Your WordPress Site Safe with Git: A Simpler Way to Update Plugins" for website owners with basic technical knowledge.

The article should explain how to use Git to manage WordPress plugin updates, covering:

1. The problem:
   - Security risks of outdated plugins
   - How plugin updates can break site functionality
   - Why updating plugins randomly/inconsistently makes things worse

2. The Git-based solution benefits:
   - Ability to see what changes with each update
   - Option to undo problematic updates
   - Efficient storage by only tracking plugin files
   - A better alternative to WordPress auto-updates

3. Include a simple explanation of how my bash script automates this process:
   - Checking which plugins need updates
   - Updating each plugin individually
   - Recording version changes in Git commits
   - Skipping plugins marked to ignore

4. Add a brief "getting started" section with basic steps for implementation.

Keep the tone friendly and relatable, using metaphors and real-world examples that WordPress site owners will understand. Avoid deep technical jargon or complex Git terminology. Focus on the peace of mind and security benefits rather than the technical implementation details.

The target audience is WordPress website owners who are comfortable with basic technical concepts but aren't developers or DevOps specialists.
